		   README for cmockery library

This is cmockery, lightweight library that is used to author C unit
tests.

There are README and NEWS files in most of the program sub-directories
which give more information about those specific programs.

It is now possible to automatically configure and build a variety of
tools with one command.  To build all of the tools contained herein,
run the ``configure'' script here, e.g.:

	./configure 
	make

To install them (by default in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, etc),
then do:
	make install

(If the configure script can't determine your type of computer, give it
the name as an argument, for instance ``./configure sun4''.  You can
use the script ``config.sub'' to test whether a name is recognized; if
it is, config.sub translates it to a triplet specifying CPU, vendor,
and OS.)

If you have more than one compiler on your system, it is often best to
explicitly set CC in the environment before running configure, and to
also set CC when running make.  For example (assuming sh/bash/ksh):

	CC=gcc ./configure
	make

A similar example using csh:

	setenv CC gcc
	./configure
	make
